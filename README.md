# Site for applications
The idea behind this is to implement some ideas in machine learning or deep learning in order to be able to see,check or play with the applications.
In the meantime I have developped two applications one for digit recognition and the other one for image/picture recognition

# How to use it
Just run python3 app.py. Do not forget to add a requirements.txt to make it easier when running the previous command
To run all the needed librairies/modiles/frameworks in requirement.txt just do pip install -r requirement.txt
